# String Art Generator

This web application allows you to create string art from an image. You can upload an image, choose a shape for the pins, and the application will generate a step-by-step guide to create the string art.

## How to Use

1.  **Upload an Image:** Click the "Upload Image" button and select an image file.
2.  **Choose a Shape:** Select either a circle or a square for the pin layout.
3.  **Set the Number of Pins:** Adjust the number of pins to be used. More pins will create a more detailed image.
4.  **Set the Number of Threads:** Adjust the number of threads to be used. More threads will create a darker image.
